# SPI Project for TMS320F28335 with MX25L320EM2I-12G Flash

This repository contains a project for interfacing an SPI Flash memory (MX25L320EM2I-12G) with the Texas Instruments TMS320F28335 microcontroller. The project is written in C and demonstrates the SPI communication protocol to operate the flash memory.

## Overview

The SPI Project is designed to interface the MX25L320EM2I-12G flash memory with the TMS320F28335 microcontroller via SPI. It includes example code for initializing the SPI module, sending commands to the flash memory, and performing read and write operations.

### Features

- SPI initialization and configuration for TMS320F28335
- Flash memory operations: read, write, and erase
- Example code for basic SPI communication with MX25L320EM2I-12G
- Error handling and status checking

## Requirements

- **Microcontroller:** Texas Instruments TMS320F28335
- **SPI Flash Memory:** MX25L320EM2I-12G
- **Compiler:** TI Code Composer Studio (CCS) or a compatible C compiler
- **Hardware:** TMS320F28335 development board, MX25L320EM2I-12G flash memory, and associated circuitry
